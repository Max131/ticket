Ticket
======

Remember when someone told you "size isn't everything"? Well, they were right.

Ticket for Anchor CMS is designed to be small but powerful. Utilising all the features and options Anchor has to offer.

Not only is this a good theme to roll with but also a great starting point for your own theme. Cut, paste, delete, do whatever you like. All I ask is that you show me what you come up with.

It's your ticket out of here.

Options
-------

Ticket has a custom field option within the article template, its simply called 'image'. To utilise it go to Extend > Custom Fields in your Anchor admin area. Click 'Create new field' on the right, and fill the options shown below:

- Type: post
- Field: image
- Unique key: image
- Label: Image
- File types: jpg, png, gif
- Width: 440
- Height: 440

When you're done click Save, and you're done! The most important fields are the type, because the code is only in the article.php template, and the width, because 440px is the width of the theme.

Finally there is the search.php template, if you want a search page on your site just create a page calledâ€¦ Search. Anchor CMS will pick up on the slug of the page and match it to the template in the theme.

Cheers, Dave
